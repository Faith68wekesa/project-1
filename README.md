# project-1
Greenfiy your commute


Description: This project aims to develop a mobile application that encourages users to choose eco-friendly commuting options like cycling, walking, or carpooling. The app would track their commutes, calculate carbon footprint reduction, and potentially offer rewards or gamification elements to promote sustainable choices.
